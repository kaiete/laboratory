---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to kaiete.github.io/laboratory/?***put your html here*** (maybe **kaiete.github.io/laboratory/?\<p>hi\</p>**)
#### Step 2:
**Error 404**

There are no more steps. Yes, that's it.

## Warnings

* If you use the domain laboratory.k.vu to attempt going to Laboratory, this will work however ***do not*** type in https:// at the beginning, use http:// instead.
This is because the certificate is given to github.com not laboratory.k.vu so your browser will most likely block the page from loading.
* For some reason, instead of putting in \<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">example\</p> you will have to put \<p style="font-family:sans-serif;">example\</p>.
